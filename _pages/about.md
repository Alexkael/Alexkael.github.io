<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Exeter, building on my previous experiences at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Liverpool. I earned my PhD from the University of Liverpool, under the guidance of [Prof. Xiaowei Huang](https://cgi.csc.liv.ac.uk/~xiaowei/) and [Prof. Xinping Yi](https://sites.google.com/site/xinpingyi00/).

My research centres on developing efficient and reliable algorithms for modern machine learning models and applications. I focus on key aspects such as generalisation, robustness, privacy, and interpretability, always striving to provide formal theoretical guarantees and analyses. Additionally, I am actively engaged in the emerging field of building trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs).

I am pleased to announce multiple openings for PhD and internship positions for the 2024/25 academic year. Scholarships are available through the [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/pg-research/funding/phdfunding/) and the [CSC-Exeter program](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/pg-research/csc-scholarships/). If you are interested in these opportunities or would like to discuss potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to contact me at g.jin@exeter.ac.uk.
