Gaojie is a final year PhD student in computer science at university of Liverpool, under the advisory of Prof. Xiaowei Huang and Dr. Xinping Yi.

His research focuses on developing efficient, reliable algorithms (generalization, robustness, privacy, interpretability, etc) for modern machine learning models and applications, with formal theoretical guarantees and analyses. He is also interested in applying machine learning techniques to vision and financial applications.
